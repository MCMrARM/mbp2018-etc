This is a modified version of the hid-apple.c Linux driver adding brightness support.

The hid-apple.c.patch file can be applied over the 9cf6b756cdf2cd38b8b0dac2567f7c6daf5e79d5 commit of the Linux
source tree (probably should apply on other versions of the kernel as well).

The driver can also be built out of source using the provided source files and has been tested on Linux 5.1.16.
