This is a heavily modified version of the applesmc.c Linux driver adding T2 support. The driver was basically rewritten.

The applesmc device can now be found at: /sys/bus/acpi/devices/APP0001:00

The patches/ patch set can be applied over the ec5385196779fb927e7d8d5bf31bef14d7ce98ed commit of the Linux kernel and
to be honest, probably on anything else as that driver wasn't modified since a while.

For the T2, the driver can also be built out of source using the provided applesmc_t2_kmod.c file and has been tested
on Linux 5.1.16. Please note that the applesmc_t2_kmod.c source file was modified to disable accelerometer as it used
non-exported Linux APIs, and as such probably should not be used on devices that do have accelerometers.

The applesmc.c file is the patched version of the applesmc.c driver, however it won't compile out of tree. It's provided
as a convenience and a way to quickly review the modifications as a whole.
